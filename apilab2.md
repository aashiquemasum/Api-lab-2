1. Send your first request:
Can you tell us in your own word what happened after making your first request?

Ans: I sent a get request to postman-echo.com/get from postman. So, postman is acting as client and postman-echo/get is acting as API server. After getting the above request, API server processed it and respond back to postman. At last postman received the response and displayed in the response body.
